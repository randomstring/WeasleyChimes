# Weasley Chimes

Automate playing a grandfather clock's chimes using a raspberry pi and
some stepper motors.

This is part of my ongoing project to build a working [Weasley
Clock][https://github.com/randomstring/WeasleyClock). That project is
now feature complete (notice I didn't say "done") and installed in my
home. 

I plan to enhance to clock by re-installing the Westminster chimes
that came with the grandfather clock I used to house my Weasley Clock.

I'm keeping a running [Build Log](./BuildLog.md) to augment the
resources in this README.

## Chimes

- The grandmother/grandfather clock came with a set of chimes. I plan
  to integrate them once I have the clock mechanism finished. I found
  an example implementation.
