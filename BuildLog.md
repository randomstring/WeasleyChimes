# Build Log

I realized after building a working [Weasley
Clock](https://github.com/randomstring/WeasleyClock) that I should
have kept a diary of my progress. You could piece together the journey
looking at the git change log, but that's not idea. The `README.md` for
that project is cluttered with my notes making it hard to discern what
I actually ended up doing. With the start of a new project, I'm
beginning this build log.
